## This year's resolution - Speak in English perfect.

Last year December. I have decided to talk in English perfect then started browsing the best utilities to learn. I have joined different mediums like clubhouse and related apps. I have already used one app called "speak English". This app is used to talk with other people and connects you with different countries and got a beautiful experience with this app. Coming to the clubhouse app, we have groups here that will use for various purposes like improving English speaking, singing, politics, and many more. I tried all these and used them for a few days.

New year and January came. I have used these for only a few weeks. Then I got more work from my office project, not even spending enough time with these apps. Later I have modified my resolution to weekends. It has also worked for a month only. Since February, I have completely ignored this app and only focused on work. In September, I had appraisals with my CTO. He also said that you need to improve your speaking skills. It is okay for some clients but, a few clients will be strict in communication. In that case, you must prepare with good speaking skills. Then again started using it for a few weeks and ignored it as usual.

Today I had another meeting with the tech lead and CTO about my objectives. He has listed a few more things that we need to post two tech blogs in a month. Writing daily status emails to founders and teams is also mandatory. I felt happy because a few weeks back joined this challenge and did not have much interest in writing these blogs in starting days. But I have thought that it leads to start any new resolution, so I was trying to attend daily here. Before joining here, I did not know how to fix Grammarly yellow line issues. Later I started watching related videos and got the basics a bit. It was helpful for me to Quickstart writing tech blogs without any fear.
