It is about today's task

## Favourite trip

My favourite trip is Deomali, it is in the Odessa state and Andhra border. I went there last year November with 2 of my college friends. Actually we four members are planning to go with 2 bikes, on evening one person got left and he was not sent bike. But we were decided to go at any cost, it is 11'O clock all options are going out, Finally, we got one unconditioned scooty. The distance is 150KM from pendurthy and started to destination, we three are driven alternatively. I think this trip is adventurous, why because dirty roads that too ghaty and we do not have a license, helmet, bike papers. It takes 12 hours to reach, started at 11 PM and reach by 8 in the morning. I can not express the feeling I get there. We were enjoyed and chilled hardly. later we returned to Vizag, by reaching salur we were caught by border polices they just take a bike pic and we also didn't start, we talked with him and he deleted pics. In salur we were loaded with stuff and started, Odissa polices are the best because they don't stop us, only in Andhra so many are stopped in every town.

From tomorrow onwards I will try to write at my best.
