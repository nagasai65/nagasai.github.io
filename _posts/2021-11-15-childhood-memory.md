## One of the childhood memory

I only feel happy while returning home from school. I used to go by school bus, and my village is far from school, so we need to wait till the last trip, it takes two hours. One day I went outside with one buddy to a park, which is so far from school. We both were in a playful mood and didn't observe the time. As you thought, my bus came, and all were waiting for us. We have reached after two hours, driver and bus mates were so tensed and angered. Whenever we entered the bus, all were looking anger. The driver had beaten us because he got so many calls from parents. After reaching every stop in my route, their parents were waiting for their children. I felt something happy on this day because I am the reason for this shit.
