## Requesting manager for leave.

Subject: Requesting you to grant leave for 15 days from 1st Dec to 15th Dec

Hi Sir, 

I am Nagasai, from the React-Native team. I have 15 days trip with college friends next month, after two years we all met together. I will try to complete current sprint tasks in 2 to 3 days. Then I will support QA, meanwhile trying to fix high priority bugs. Please don't include me in the next sprint. Please grant me a leave for 15 days starting from first December. I miss these guys so badly.

Thank you,
Nagasai,
React-native team.
