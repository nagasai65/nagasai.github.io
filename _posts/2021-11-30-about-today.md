## About Today

I can say today is very bored. I started to wake up at 8'O clock but woke up at 9. After
fresh up came to the office by 10'O clock, I have taken breakfast Utappa with tomato
chutney. Currently, I am working on a payoff planner task in the Freebird project. After
breakfast, I had a call with the designer. We discuss the new flow in UI, and I have taken
some missing inputs from the designs. Next, I sat down with the product manager, and he
tested my API, which has done two days ago. Then we discussed the product and other 
things. Then the time is 1'O clock, and I had lunch it takes 1 hour. Later we had a
standup call and discussed pain points in a task, then I have started working on UI.
Later, I have joined another call for integrating the force update feature. We have
finalised the schema and its workflow.

Later I have joined in a writing challenge call at 7'O clock. Today they have asked us to
write down what happened today. I have started writing the challenge. After one paragraph,
our colleague came and asked me to prepare the questionnaire paper for tomorrow's drive
because they need xerox copies by 8'30, so Ajay and I paused and prepared questions. Later
need to get out for some work, and I returned to the office by 9. Then we had our dinner,
later resumed today's task and completed now.

Today office is also quiet because most of the people went for recruitment. I have asked
permission from my product manager that I will go for tomorrow's drive. But he didn't give
and said that we have so much work this week and  we can take interviews online if they
need help. Then I have said this to the recruitment team as I can't come tomorrow.
