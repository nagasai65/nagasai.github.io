It is about my journey in first company

## About


I am working in Tilicho labs as a React-native app developer. I have started working here in 2020 Feb, starting with an internship after 6 months I got a full-time offer. React-native is now trending technology, using this we can easily develop apps on different platforms like android, iOS, macOS, windows, web. In the Internship the first month we were done with java assignments later, all interns are split into various teams and I got this team, in 3 months I have quickly started development and 2 mini apps are developed. after that I was allocated to the "Freebird" team, with this project I have learned so many things in react-native and got more familiar on work and technology. Slowly we started working with the backend too, it is also javascript so easily get work done daily.

Recently I was assigned to another project "DOTO", which is related to cricket predictions. Previously it is available in android then they wanted to release it in iOS too, so they decided react-native is best to serve our requirements and no need to get both android and iOS developers.

I think this start-up company is better to start a career, each person will work on one project completely. also, we got support from our seniors
