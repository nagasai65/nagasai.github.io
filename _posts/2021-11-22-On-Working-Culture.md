## How companies treat their employees

First, I will share my experience in my current company, Tilicho labs. We are so happy with the way they treated us. They do not see us as workers, giving us enough time to do anything. When we are stuck with any problem, people give suggestions when it seems easy Otherwise, show known blogs related to that problem. You can see a homely nature here, can talk with your superiors as your brother. Support with clients in all situations, sometimes annoying, not giving enough time to fix bugs and not giving enough inputs in development.

We can expect this culture from most companies. Some of the companies are very crucial. The organisers and team leaders do not support them.
