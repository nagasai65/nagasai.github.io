## It was a favourite memory with my best friend.

She came to Vizag for some work after that, we both met at the complex. I was too hungry and went to Mandi ate a lot that too it was tasty. Then we went to RK beach while feeling that joy! I got an idea to go to the movie then we went for a movie. After that we started to Araku on my bike, we have talked a lot on this journey, by night we reached a hotel near borra caves. We had our dinner and slept there.

The next day, we went to Katiki waterfalls that were great in the morning and had breakfast. Then we started to borra caves, which is next to waterfalls. Then we went to Araku and visited a few places. Then we returned to Vizag earlier because she had to catch the evening's train to her home.

She enjoyed so much that weekend. It was the first time she came with me alone, and I didn't get words to express my feeling.
